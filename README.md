##Schedule Manager API and Frontend Documentation
This document outlines the backend API endpoints and frontend requirements for the Schedule Manager, a team-based scheduling application similar to When2Meet. The app allows organizations to manage teams, players, events, and availability, with a focus on scheduling team activities. The backend is built with Go and PostgreSQL, running in a Dockerized environment, while the frontend is under development.
