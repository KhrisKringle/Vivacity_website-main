## Schedule Manager API and Frontend Documentation
This document outlines the backend API endpoints and frontend requirements for the Schedule Manager, a team-based scheduling application similar to When2Meet. The app allows organizations to manage teams, players, events, and availability, with a focus on scheduling team activities. The backend is built with Go and PostgreSQL, running in a Dockerized environment, while the frontend is under development.
## Backend API
The backend provides RESTful endpoints for managing Teams, Players, and Events, with planned integrations for Discord and potential email notifications. All endpoints are prefixed with /api.
## Teams
